# Lele ‘very’ is used only if there is a gradable qualifier in the noun phrase, including mātuā
# and tamā. (Note: a gradable qualifier is one which allows o f comparison. Words like fu a efa
# ‘big, fat’ and gali ‘beautiful’ are gradable, whereas hima ‘made of cement’ is not.)

he mātuā ika lele
# ‘an absolutely huge fish’

he tino lelei lele
# ‘a very good man’

# Lava intensifies the meaning of the word it follows. It may modify the head word plus any
# qualifiers, or it may intensify a qualifying word:

Ko he ā te mea tēnā? Ko he fa le lava!
# ‘What is that thing? It is a house!’

Ko he a te fale tênā? Ko te fale fo n o lava.
# ‘What is that building? It is the meeting house.’

te ko fu kukula lava
‘the red shirt’ (not the other one)

# Lava is also used to form reflexives:

Kua kofu te tauale e ia lava
# ‘The patient has dressed him self

Na lavea ia i a te ia lava
# ‘He hurt himself’


# e: This preposition marks the agent of a transitive verb (see below, 5.1):

Na kaumai te polo e te tamaiti.
# ‘The child brought the ball’

E he iloa e au.
# ‘I don’t know’


# i
# This preposition has a number of meanings, including in, at, with, because of, from. Its
#basic meaning is to indicate location in a place:

Nae nofo te toeaina i te nofoa.
# ‘The old man was sitting in the chair’

Vaelua te lākau i te toki.
# ‘Split the wood with the axe’


# Locative noun phrases differ in structure from other noun phrases. When a locative noun is
# preceded by a preposition, it does not take an article. If it is the unmarked noun of a sentence
# (5.1), it is preceded by the particle ia. Other grammatical words which may occur in a locative
# noun phrase are postmodifiers like lele, lava and the directional particles (5.11), or a premodifying
# possessive pronoun minus its article component (4.3.2):

Fano ki gāuta lele.
# ‘Go right inland’

Nofo i ona tua.
# ‘Sit behind him’

E takalo te tamaiti i lalo ifo o te laulau.
# ‘The child is playing under the table’

E gali ia Fenualoa.
# ‘Fenualoa is pretty’



E kikila atu au ki a te koe.
# ‘I am looking at you’

Na kai e ki maua te ika.
# ‘We two ate the fish’

Kua maua te tuhi mai ia te koe.
# ‘The letter from you has arrived’

Kā olo koulua?
# ‘Are you two going now?’

Na fakatali pea ia kita.
# ‘I just waited’






# 5.1. Transitive and intransitive

# Examples of transitive sentences:

Na fau e ia tona fale.
#  ‘He built his house’

Na kai te ika e Mele.

# Examples of intransitive sentences:

# ‘The pig is squealing’

# 5.2 TENSE-ASPECT PARTICLES


Ko tena te fale nae nonofo ai oku mātua.
# ‘That’s the house where my parents used to live’

Na teka te vaka i te vāiaho taluai.
# ‘The boat departed last week’


# 5.2.2 ka
# This particle indicates a situation that is going to take place in the future, subsequent to the
# time of speaking. Usually it refers to the immediate future:

Ka fano te vaka.
# ‘The boat is about to leave’

# 5.2.3 koi
# This particle indicates that a situation is still going on at the present time, although it may be
# expected to stop at some future time:

Koi ola ō mātua?
# ‘Are your parents still living?’
# Note that one does not say *Koi i te VahaPahefika iaAtafu ‘Atafu is still in the Pacific Ocean’,
# because there is no possibility of this ceasing to be the case.

# The other verbal particles discussed below can be used to refer to past, present or future time.
# It is usually clear from the context which is intended.

# 5.2.4 kua
# This particle has a number of rather subtle uses, all of which imply change or development.
# Two uses are particularly common. It can indicate an event that has taken place recently and is
# felt by the speaker to have created a new situation:

Kua hau to tamana.
# ‘Your father has arrived’
# or it can refer to a changed state:

Kua tauale to tamana.
# ‘Your father is ill’ or ‘Your father has become ill’
# Either way, kua always means that a change has come about, or will come about at some future
# time:

Olo oi tāfafao oi kua omai ai.
# ‘Go and amuse yourselves, and then you will come back’

# 5.2.5 e
# The non-past marker e has the widest and vaguest meaning of the tense-aspect particles. It
# may indicate a permanent truth, or something that will happen in the future, or a situation that
# exists at the time of speaking or that is concurrent with some other situation in the past or the
# future. E is in fact used quite often to refer to things that happened in the past, provided this is
# clear from the context of the narrative.

E vevela te lā.
# ‘The sun is hot’

E fa n o au ki Niu Hila i te tauhaga fo u.
# ‘I’m going to New Zealand next year’

E nofo ia Hina i luga o te vaka kae oho ifo ia Tokalalaga ki lalo.
# ‘While Hina sat on the canoe, Tokalalaga dived down below’
